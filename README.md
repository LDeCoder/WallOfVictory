# WallOfVictory
This is going to be an app to celebrate the amazing breakthrough God has brought to individual lives.  It will be created using HTML5 and some amazing CSS and animations and Spring Tool Suite for persisting some incredible data!  If you need breakthrough in your own life, load this up and read stories about someone who has overcome the very adversity that you are facing - grab hold of God's promises and claim them for yourself! God is not a respector of persons - if He did it for them, He will do it for you! Revelation says we overcome by the blood of the lamb and the WORD OF OUR TESTIMONY!  Breakthrough is HERE!
**I am also creating a version of this app in a repo called wall-of-victory that uses React.js and including some React Spring for your viewing pleasure!**
